# CIS-444 
## Lecture-18
 

### Swift Playgrounds. Our new virtual format requires a new way to evaulate progress in this course so far. The quiz I designed uses Swift Playgrounds. Outside of quizzes we will not use playgrounds. Today's lecture is focused on swift playground basics and give you the opportunity to begin work on [Project Planning Part 3](https://github.com/SyracuseUniversity-CIS444/Project-Planning-Part-3)  and [Quiz](https://github.com/SyracuseUniversity-CIS444/Quiz-1)
