* [ ] Swift Playgrounds. Our new virtual format requires a new way to evaulate progress in this course so far. The quiz I designed uses Swift Playgrounds for some sections. Outside of the quiz we will not use them. Today's lecture is focused on learning the basics of Swift Playgrounds and beginning  project planning #3 and the quiz
